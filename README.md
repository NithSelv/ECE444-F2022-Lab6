## Pros and Cons of Test Driven Development

# Pros
Test driven development provides many benefits such as better code quality and flexibility. For example, it is easier to write code that can fufill one function as opposed to fufilling multiple objectives simultaneously. This allows programmers to focus on writing a particular piece of code to complete one task well before moving to the next. Therefore, a logical sequence of task completion can be made which allows prohrammers to finish their work succinctly. In addition, feature creep can be avoided until after the basic features have been written and their quality has been ensured. Thus, a minimum functionality has been achieved before additional features can be introduced which may cause issues and may need to be rolled back.

Furthermore, test driven development allows programmers to interchange parts of the code as needed. For example, tests may need to be revised to account for new information from stakeholders and thus, certain parts of the code may need to be updated. With test driven development, those tests can be updated and then the code can be checked to see which components actually need to be changed to get the code functioning again. This allows programmers to avoid wasteful effort on updating code that may have little to no impact. 

Finally, test driven development often has better documentation because each component and feature is tested individually and thus the documentation of each function is very clear. There is no need for large amounts of complex code that is only tested at the end which may disguise the effects of bug propagation between features. Therefore, test driven development helps with error checking because programmers can isolate system errors down to whichever unit test is failing.
